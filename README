1) How to add a new static monster

The MoMoMonster class represents all monsters which are not animated. It reads available data from the file moMoMonsters.txt .
A monster has
	- a picture:	* black&white, if possible a drawing, I do not accept color.
			* maximum dimensions 640x480 pixel
			* Licensed under Creative Commons CC BY-NC or CC BY-NC-SA or CC BY-SA
	- a name

You can send the couple to me netscraper@web.de and I will include it.
